<h2><span class="blue">About Me</span></h2>

<p>Hello Everyone! Welcome to my page. My name is Honya Elfayoumy, it is nice to meet you all! I am currently a senior at the University of North Florida (I will be graduating Spring 2019. I am majoring in Computer Science - a subject I have always admired. Growing up, I actually wanted to be a doctor, however, that escalated quickly when I realized I was terrified of needles and blood. With the guidance of my father, I sought computer science in 8th grade. I was able to be mentored by Terry Smith, Walter Schuller, and Larry Snedden at the UNF School of Computing. During this time, I learned A LOT! They taught me about the basics of computing by exploring various technologies, learning Python for data development and programming robot arms, as well as computer hardware and repair.</p>
 
<p>I believe my time spent at the UNF School of Computing really sparked my interests in computing. From there, I went on to intern at NLP Logix where I assisted in research with the Duval County Sheriff's Office. I was fortunate enough to present my final data analysis to the Mayor's Chief of Staff. After this internship, I was recognized nationally by the National Center of Women & Information Technology! This motivated me to do more and be more active in computing. I went on to intern at Web.com, System Innovators, and now Florida Blue.</p>

<h2><span class="red">Hobbies & Interests</span></h2>

<p>Whenever someone asks me this question, I don't quite know how to answer. Usually I am too busy to partake in any hobbies. On my weekends, I usually spend quality time with friends and family - and then of course, do my homework if I have any! I usually have the most fun when I am traveling. I love seeing new places and learning about different cultures. I am always so amused by how different each place I have been to is. So far, I have been to New York, District of Columbia, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Oregon, California, and lastly my favorite destination of all, EGYPT! I hope to travel more once I graduate.</p>

<p>Besides traveling, I really enjoy watching new movies and shows which is why Netflix is probably my most visited site. When I am very calm (rarely any stress), one of my favorite hobbies is writing - not any particular genre of literature but just journal writing. I like to read my entries later on and reminisce.</p>
